## What is the problem with FashioNet?


Even though it was an interesting project, __the project has not been updated since 2017__. There were many issue calls by different users concering FashioNet malfunctioning but __none has been answered__ since the author himeself has been unactive from 2017. The versions used for __libraries weren't stated, datasets weren't provided and the code itself was outdated__.
